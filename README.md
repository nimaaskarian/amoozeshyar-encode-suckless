# Amoozeshyar decode suckless
A small program written in Rust. Reads your input from stdin and uses dark reverse engineering magic to convert them into searchable terms. Just like [Amoozshyar change](https://amozeshyar.info/change/) but faster.  
The binary is called `enc-am` which is an abbreviation for `encode Amoozeshyar`. Reads stdin like good old POSIX commands, And writes back to stdin.
